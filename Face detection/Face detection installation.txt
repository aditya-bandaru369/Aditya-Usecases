Step 1: Install Python
The code in this article is built using Python version 3.5. Although there are multiple ways to install Python, I would recommend using Anaconda – the most popular Python distribution for data science. Here is a link to install Anaconda in your system.
Step 2: Install OpenCV
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library aimed at building computer vision applications. It has numerous pre-written functions for image processing tasks. To install OpenCV, do a pip install of the library:
pip3 install opencv-python
Step 3: Install face_recognition API;
Finally, we will use face_recognition, dubbed as the world’s simplest facial recognition API for Python. To install:

pip install dlib
pip install face_recognition

Note:
To install dlib there are few pre-requisites such as, we need to have Visual Studio 2015 and above versions.
Also we need to make sure CMake v3.8.2 is installed.
